# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Case-Study-

For my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I will be looking at a dataset taken from Kaggle which is called the World Happinest Report(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)  
I want to take a look at happiness levels and based on their happiness score, we determine whether or not the country is a great buiness partner. The metrics that we will examinate is happiness score, GDP score, Freedom score, and Corruption score. Programs used for this project includes Excel and SQL.
